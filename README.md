# h3x4d3c1m4l's Coding Challenges Tool

This is my [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) project with solutions for problems from some coding challenges I have done.

Additionally I'd like this project to serve as a sample and demo for GitHub Actions, GitHub Pages and Flutter Web.

When a PR is merged to the `main` branch, it gets deployed here: https://h3x4d3c1m4l.github.io/AdventOfCode2022/

## This tool currently contains solutions for

- [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

## Features

### Done

- [x] Auto deploy `main` branch to GitHub Pages
- [x] Simple [Fluent UI](https://pub.dev/packages/fluent_ui) based interface
- [X] Track and show duration of solver run
- [X] Error handling
- [X] Show solver code

### Planned

- [ ] Run problem solver asynchronically
- [ ] Custom problem/solution views (currently it only works with string input/output)
- [ ] Link to problem web page
